# Invoice Processing and Analysis for a Small Bar

This repository contains a lightweight and customizable tool for processing and analyzing invoice data for a small bar. The project aims to simplify the management of accounting, track costs, and gain insight into expenses through structured data processing and reporting.

## 📊 Overview

The main output of the project is an Excel file that aggregates invoice data and provides a clear visualization of:

- Invoice totals  
- Supplier breakdowns  
- Monthly and seasonal trends  
- Categorized expenses  

This solution is especially designed for small seasonal businesses, such as bars or restaurants with fewer than 10 employees, that want to digitize their operations without investing in complex ERP systems.

## 🚧 Project Status

This is an **early-stage prototype**. The current version focuses on:

- Manual import of invoice data (files are **not** included in this repo)  
- Basic preprocessing and normalization of invoice fields  
- Generation of summary Excel reports  

All raw data files (invoices) and generated plots are excluded from the repository via `.gitignore`.

## 💡 Future Development

Pending alignment with the bar owner, the project may evolve to:

- Integrate data from other sources (e.g. POS/cash register exports)  
- Automate recurring reporting workflows  
- Enable more advanced cost analysis and forecasting  
- Serve as a general-purpose template for small hospitality businesses 


## 🔒 Data Privacy

All invoice data and business-sensitive outputs are excluded from the repository to preserve privacy and confidentiality.
